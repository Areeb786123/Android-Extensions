# Android Extensions

![Navigation Tests](https://github.com/tunjid/Android-Extensions/workflows/Navigation%20Tests/badge.svg)

This repository is a collection of modules to help bootstrap an Android Application.
There are 10 modules:

|   | Name  | Description  |   |   |
| ------------| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1  | App | A sample app demoing the modules in the repository.  |   |   |
| 2  | [Core (1.3.0)](https://github.com/tunjid/Android-Extensions/blob/develop/core/README.md)  | A few added utilities to the core Android KTX libraries.  Includes extension methods on objects to side step ContextCompat, DrawableCompat, and a fluent SpannableString API | ![](https://i.imgur.com/AFZpZ1K.png)  | ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/4904/1*o4p71Uid8vzAHvHH7W_LjQ.png)  |
| 3  | [Navigation (1.2.0-rc02)](https://github.com/tunjid/Android-Extensions/blob/develop/navigation/README.md)  | Interfaces and implementations of Fragment based Navigators, including single and multiple stacks. The APIs allow for hooking into the raw `FragmentTransactions` that run allow you to customize it to your heart's content. Suspending APIs are also available to preform navigation actions sequentially without having to deal with the asynchrosity of the `FragmentManager`.| ![](https://i.imgur.com/2Ai74xI.png)  | ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q1WqvY91CWlmAjdEiwbA_g.gif)  |
| 4  | [View (1.2.0)](https://github.com/tunjid/Android-Extensions/blob/develop/view/README.md)  | A module containing UI building blocks, like animators and helper methods for views.  Built mostly around the `SpringAnimation` from the Jetpack `DynamicAnimation` library. In the example to the right, it is responsible for animating the margin, and padding of the container views, and the hiding and showing of bouncing FABs.| ![](https://i.imgur.com/K3qGDKb.gif)  |   |
| 5  | [RecyclerView (1.2.0)](https://github.com/tunjid/Android-Extensions/blob/develop/recyclerview/README.md)  | Utility classes for the ```RecyclerView``` ```ViewGroup``` like drag and drop, swipe gestures, endless scrolling, a composable adapter, diffing, tables and much more.  | ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/580/1*SjjLx1ghigvJP7kax-K6gA.gif)  | ![](https://i.imgur.com/hpb3YFu.gif)  |
| 6  | [Material (1.0.4)](https://github.com/tunjid/Android-Extensions/blob/develop/material/README.md)  | Utility classes around Google's Material Design components including an expandable floating action button.  | ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/648/1*NHgDmR6QVqQwj7VJToQE5w.gif)  |   |
| 7  | [Communications (1.0.0)](https://github.com/tunjid/Android-Extensions/blob/develop/communications/README.md)  | Utility classes for Near Service Discovery (NSD) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.  |   |   |
| 8  | [Saved State (1.0.1)](https://github.com/tunjid/Android-Extensions/blob/develop/savedstate/README.md)  | Delegated implementation of Android Jetpack's Saved State Registry for Components that also have a lifecycle.  |   |   |
| 9  | [ConstraintLayout (Unmaintained, MotionLayout is here)](https://github.com/tunjid/Android-Extensions/blob/develop/constraintlayout/README.md)  | Utility classes for the ```ConstraintLayout``` ```ViewGroup```.  |   |   |
| 10  | [Test (Unmaintained)](https://github.com/tunjid/Android-Extensions/blob/develop/test/README.md)  | Testing utilities built mostly around Espresso.  |   |   |

## Publishing

Publishing is done with the `maven-publish` plugin.

To publish, run:

`./gradlew incrementalPublish`

This will publish the latest version of every module, and will not override existing versions.
The version of the module is determined by the version.properties file. To bump a module version, bump it in version.properties.

By default, the `version_suffix`, `publishRepoName`, `publishUrl`, `publishUserName` and `publishPassword` are read from the `local.properties` file.
They can however be overriden by passing gradle properties via the `-P` flag for each property you wish to override.

A sample local.properties looks like:

```
version_suffix=mysuffix
publishRepoName=MyMaven
publishUrl=https://maven.pkg.github.com/myOrg/Android-Extensions
publishUserName=mygithubusername
publishPassword=mygithubtoken
```
